"""
usage: tk-flake8 [--diff=<commit-branch-tag>] [--] [<flake8-args>...]

Runs flake8 against the source code. If the flake8 configuration file contains diffcompare=True
then validation will be run only on lines modified from the origin/master branch.

Arguments <flake8-args> passed after -- will be passed to flake8 directly. tk-flake8 will take care
of passing down --diff and the diff when required.

Options:
 --diff commit-branch-tag -d commit-branch-tag      Run Flake8 against another branch. Defaults to origin/master
